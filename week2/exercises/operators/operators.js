/* 
- Create variables a and b, and assign them integer values.
- Use add, subtraction, multiply, divide, and modulus operator for a and b. Store each result in separate variables (sum, difference, product, quotient, reminder). Calculate the remainder of a divided by b using the modulus operator and store it in a variable called remainder.

- Use console.log() to print the results of each operation to the console.

- Add comments in your code to explain what each operation does. */

let a = 10;

let sum = a + b; // Addition of a and b
let difference = a - b; // Substraction a from b
let product = a * b; // Multiplication of a and b
let quotient = a / b; // Dividation of a by b
let reminder = a % b; // Modulus of a by b


console.log(`
Add: ${sum}
Substruction: ${difference}
Product: ${product}
Multiply: ${product}
Divide: ${quotient}
Remainder: ${reminder}

OUTPUT
----------
Add: 15
Substruction: 5
Product: 50
Multiply: 50
Divide: 2
Remainder: 0
